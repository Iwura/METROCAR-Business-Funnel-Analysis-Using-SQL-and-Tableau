The main objective of this project was to analyze the customer funnel of Metrocar to identify areas for improvement and optimization.

The dataset was made up of five tables, which were explored using SQL. They were joined using SQL and aggregated at various stages of the ride activities to reveal the funnel steps and metrics associated with them using the "percentage of previous" and "percentage of top approach". Finally, the aggregated dataset was further analyzed and visualized to reveal the funnel metrics using Tableau.

The ride request-to-ride acceptance step witnessed the highest drop-off rate of about 35.6%.

It was discovered that 58.02% of all requested rides were completed, 35.57% were not accepted and eventually canceled by the user, while 6.41% were accepted but still canceled by the user.

Most rides were canceled due to long acceptance waiting times of as little as 2 minutes by users.

Recommendations were made to set the acceptance waiting time to a maximum of 1 minute and channel more marketing budget towards iOS users and users within the 35â€“44 age group.

Also, surge pricing was proposed to be implemented for ride requests between 07:00 and 09:00 hours and between 15:00 and 17:00 hours of the day.
